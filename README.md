# pythonApp
This is my first Window app coded in Python.
The idea is NOT original but slightly modified from the work of Zinglecode, who shows the same app for iOS in YouTube.
I standardized the program for self-training.

__Goal:__ To show the multiplication table for any number except zero.

__Input:__ a number (integer) the user typing in an input box in order to check the multiplication table of that number.

__Output:__ A multiplication table associated with the number keyed by the user.

__Steps:__

1. Import the tkinter module for creating a desktop app
2. Create a new function called "Show Output", which gets integer number transformed from the text number input
3. Check before showing the output. If number equals zero, then show the text "Zero is meaningless" and end the output function.
4. Create an output variable.
5. Create a loop to perform multiplication from 1 to 12.
6. Create a new window for my application.
7. Set the size of the app window as 400 x 400 px
8. Set the name of my app as MuliplyN.
9. Set the text on what this app does and show it in the window with space between lines at 20 px.
10. Add the input box and show it in the window. The box width 15 px.
11. Add the button, namely ได้แก่ and show it, but add the command of show_output too.
12. Set the button size.
13. Show the output with 20 px space vertically
14. Show the app window
